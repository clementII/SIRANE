#SIRANE: Thesis "Evaluating Traffic Policies on NO₂ Pollution in Brussels: Impact of the Low Emission Zone and the Good Move Plan, 2022-2035"
Welcome to this GitHub repository, which provides various codes for our thesis on evaluating political measures to reduce NO₂ concentration in Brussels (LEZ & Good Move). All codes are available as Python files, and the necessary input files are also posted with names similar to the corresponding Python files.

These codes have been used with SIRANE or are graphical results of various simulations.

Emis_rues_Affinage_route_A0-A1-A2_A5: Creation of the linear emissions file "Emis_rues" for 2022.

EmisRues_Emissions_Lineaire-BASE_WEM_WAM: Creation of the linear emissions file "Emis_rues" for the three projections BASE-WEM-WAM.

Calibration_Coefficient_SourcePonctuelle: Creation of various point source emissions files (tunnels) for 2022 and the three projections.

Graphique_Calibration_NO2-Mod_NO2-Mes: Creation of various graphs used for the calibration section between measured and modeled concentrations.

Carte_Scenario_Année_&_Difference_Année: Creation of various maps to project scenarios for specific years or compare years between scenarios.

Graphs_Concentration + SIRANEDATA_Calcul + SIRANEMapsToData: Creation of various graphs showing the exceedance of the 20 µg/m³ concentration in different street segments, the exceedance of the 20 µg/m³ concentration in different street segments by road hierarchy, the average concentration per scenario per year, and the evolution of the concentration.
